# github-repo-gallery
This is a simple web app that displays a user's Github profile information, including their name, bio, location, and number of public repositories. The app also allows users to view a list of their public repositories and filter them based on name.

Usage
To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The app will automatically fetch and display the user information for the username specified in the username variable (currently set to "adalieks").

The app will display a list of the user's public repositories, which can be clicked on to view more information about the repository, including its name, description, default branch, and languages used.

Users can also filter the repository list by typing a search query into the filter-repos input field. The app will display only the repositories whose names match the search query.

Technologies Used
This web app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Github REST API to fetch the user and repository data.
